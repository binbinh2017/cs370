<Team 4>

## 1 Design Considerations



### 1.1 Assumptions


Assumptions - Bugs may occur

Dependency - Should only work on Android Devices

Significant issue that may arise - Software compatibility across different Android versions or Phones

### 1.2 Constraints


The lists will be stored locally, so if the user deletes the app, the user might lose the list data. The user also will not be able to share lists to other users since this app is locally saved, Depending on the budget of the user app could have limited functions.

### 1.3 System Environment



Hardware - Android Devices

Software - Android API level 21 (minimum)
